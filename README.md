# Overview

This project is a **Smart To-Do List Web Application** built entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal was to solidify my understanding of core JavaScript concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, ES6 array methods, and recursion, while also learning to use external libraries in a real-world context.

I developed this application to improve my ability to write clean, maintainable JavaScript code that interacts directly with the DOM and provides a dynamic, user-friendly experience. It represents an important step in my journey as a software engineer to build full-stack web applications from scratch using client-side technologies.

The application allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks. It includes features like animated popups using SweetAlert2, task filtering, and dynamic UI rendering using JavaScript.
